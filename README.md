# ElementaryCellularAutomaton

`Elementary Cellular Automaton with ASCII graphics`

## Background
This was a fun 5-minute project. I remembered creating a cellular automaton program in Scratch for a
project I had in my computer science class through the University of Texas, Austin, and figured this would
be a fun little throwback.

## In All Fairness...
I understand elementary cellular automaton is a project that a middle-schooler could
complete (assuming they have the smallest undertanding of base 2 integers), but I feel my solution was fairly
interesting as there is very little code written and all calculations were done of integers rather than arrays 
(which I assume is the standard way a middle-schooler would write an elementary cellular automaton program)

## Output Example

`
Enter rule (0-255): 30
Enter num generations: 20
